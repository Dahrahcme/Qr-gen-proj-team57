I'm James Obekpa with GitHub name Jaykovic and here are my contributions toward the project.

I was able to build and design social media share buttons for:
 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - WhatsApp
 - Telegram
https://github.com/Jaykovic/Social_Media_Share_Button_JS

Also, added the respective APIs for the social media share buttons

On the backend side, I worked on
- Tracking users sign, signout
- Log user activities to a file when they register, sign in, sign out
- Use django signals to send and receive user information after sign in
User info with time and date can be viewed on django admin.
